DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE PROJECT


This project is a real-time collaboration tool (document editor/whiteboard) built using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO to enable instant two-way communication between users via WebSockets. The frontend is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing multiple users to simultaneously edit or draw on a shared interface. Changes made by one user are immediately broadcast to all other connected clients, ensuring a live, synchronized experience. Socket.IO simplifies WebSocket handling with event-based communication, making the system responsive and efficient. The entire project is developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for a streamlined development workflow. This setup is ideal for real-time collaborative applications like shared editors, whiteboards, or interactive tools.
